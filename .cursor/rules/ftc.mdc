🎯 Primary Goals

Competition-safe code (FTC SDK + FTCLib only)

Readable > clever

Small, testable changes

Driver-first behavior (predictable, smooth)

Fail gracefully (no crashes mid‑match)

🧱 Project Assumptions

Language: Java

Frameworks:

FTC SDK (official)

FTCLib (command-based preferred)

Hardware:

REV Control Hub / Expansion Hub

Built-in IMU (FTC IMU, not legacy BNO055)

IDE: Android Studio

🧠 Architecture Rules
1️⃣ Command-Based First

Prefer FTCLib Command-Based structure:

Subsystem → owns hardware

Command → owns behavior

RobotContainer → wiring, bindings

Avoid putting logic directly in OpModes unless explicitly asked.

Good:

DriveSubsystem

DefaultDriveCommand

TurnToHeadingCommand

Bad:

Motor math inside runOpMode()

2️⃣ One Responsibility per Class

Subsystems:

No gamepad reads

No sleeps or blocking loops

Commands:

No hardwareMap access

No static state

🧭 IMU + Sensors Rules

Use FTC IMU, wrapped or accessed via FTCLib if needed

Always:

Initialize IMU once

Reset yaw on init or start

Angles:

Degrees by default

CCW positive unless otherwise specified



🔢 Constants & Tuning

All tunables go in:

Constants.java

No magic numbers in logic

Name constants clearly:

MAX_DRIVE_SPEED

TURN_kP

DEADBAND

🧹 Style & Cleanliness

Max method length: ~30 lines

Prefer early returns

Descriptive names over comments

Comment WHY, not WHAT

🚨 Safety Rules (Non‑Negotiable)

Motors default to BRAKE if they affect motion

Servo positions clamped to [0.0, 1.0]

Check for opModeIsActive() in loops

Never block the main thread

If unsure → choose the safer option.

🧪 Debugging & Telemetry

Minimal but useful telemetry:

Heading

Mode (Auto / TeleOp state)

Errors or fallbacks

Telemetry should not spam or lag control loops.

⚡ Vibe Coding Mode (How Cursor Should Behave)

When generating code:

Start with a working baseline

Optimize later, not first

Prefer clarity over abstraction

If unsure about FTC legality → warn explicitly

When editing code:

Change the smallest surface area possible

Do not refactor unrelated files

Preserve driver feel

❌ What NOT to Do

No threads unless explicitly requested

No reflection or advanced Java tricks

No external libraries unless FTC‑legal

No guessing hardware names

Ask before changing architecture.

✅ Output Expectations

Generated code should be:

Compile-ready

FTC legal

Easily testable on a real robot

If something is ambiguous, ask one clear question before proceeding.
